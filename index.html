	<h1>WildFire Aniamtion</h1>
  	<p> Me and my teammates were trying to stop a devistating problem that happens around the world. We are talking about wildfires.
		Wildfires are very dangerous and can kill not only human lives, but can cause deforestation and killing other wildlife. So, my and my teammates went and
		tried to make an animation about wildfires, how they get caused and how dangerous they can be. This is what we came up with. <p>
      
<p> For our animation, we got a stick figure, a campfire and a tree to show how a wildfire could start. The campfire's fire got on to the tree and later on the tree started catching on fire. This is a real problem that could actually happen in real life. Here was our setup for how we would capture the pictures for our stopmotion animation;</p>
  
<p> To make the parts for our animation, we used paper and clay. The clay is used for the stick figure and the backround is made for the backround, objects like the campfire and the tree. To recieve our materials for the animation, we cut out paper for our backround, and molded clay to create a stick figure that would start the animation. To make the animation look lively, we took a picture of 1 frame, then we would move another frame to make it look like it would be moving on its own. This process took a total of 2 weeks. Here is the amount of paper that was used for this animation;
  
  <p> After 2 weeks, the project was finished. A 16 second video with a total of 240 frames. Here is our animation for our project;<p>
    
   <p> Heres a story summary, a stickfigure roasts a marshmellow on top of a campfire, which is very close to a tree. The tree slowly gets caught on fire which causes a whole wildfire. The stick figure starts running away because humans can't do anything when a wildfire starts, unless they have a water hose. The marshmellow drops into the campfire and the fire starts spreading on more and more trees. This animation represents a real problem in a world, and can happen a lot easier than you think. What we were trying to tell people is to be more careful around fire, and take care of the enviornment.
