  	<p> Me and my teammates were trying to stop a devistating problem that happends around the world. We are talking about wildfires.
		Wildfires are very dangerous and can kill not only human lives, but can cause deforestation and killing other wildlife. So, my and my teammates went and
		tried to make an animation about wildfires, how they get caused and how dangerous they can be. This is what we came up with. testing <p>
